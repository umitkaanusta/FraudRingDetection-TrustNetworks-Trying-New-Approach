# Analyzing bitcoin-otc.com Trust Network

## Introduction & Data
Raw data is taken from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-otc.html

This is a trust network of people trading Bitcoin in bitcoin-otc. bitcoin-otc is an over-the-counter
marketplace, i.e. Bitcoin is traded in a p2p fashion. Trust becomes crucial in a place where there is
no one between the buyer and the seller.

Here I will analyze this network using SNA methods, and present it in such a concise way that 
someone who hasn't seen a graph would understand the point.
